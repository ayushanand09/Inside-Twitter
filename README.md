# Inside-Twitter

The Project is about a responsive web application named "Inside Twitter". It is made using HTML, CSS and Javascript .

 ## Idea
 The main idea behind this project was to display how many twitter users are there in the world. A dummy JSON file has been used for plotting in the world map. A user-friendly website is made using **HTML,Pure CSS and Javascript**. A **feedback form** is also created for user feedback which will later be linked by a backend server.
